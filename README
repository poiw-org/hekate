Hekate
Hekate is the goddess of magic, crossroads, ghosts, the moon, necromancy, and witchcraft.
What does Hekate have to do with us?
Well... EVERYTHING. Hekate with her magical powers collects all the urls you will ever need to access as a student.
Then she gives you them in an amazing format and only a few key presses away. Isn't that magical?
She even did her research! So now every operating system can profit from her hard work (GNU/Linux, BSD, MacOS, Windows).
She hopes you will find her work satisfactory and who knows maybe some of you may propose new features!
